<div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Basketball, Twitter and the Era of the Athlete Commentator</strong></p>

<p>&mdash;</p>

<p>Sports journalism is reaching an awkward, hormonal stage in its evolution: one where entire articles annotate tweets; the dreaded [sic] imposes itself on every quote; and post-game interviews reach silly levels of non-candor.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, the antidote was fan blogging. Bill Simmons famously challenged Boston’s WEEI radio pantheon, and Henry Abott gained notoriety with TrueHoop. Now in 2013, Simmons is himself an established brand and Abbott oversees a network of TrueHoop blogs. Writing on Simmons’ own site Grantland, Carles <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8602142/the-nba-transformation-internet-friendly-juggernaut">delivered a eulogy</a> for the fan perspective:</p>

<blockquote><p>The rise of any realm of the blogosphere means the rise of the singular, independent voice. I’ll miss the NBA’s awkward transition decade and the Internet media evolution that prepared its demise. I’ll miss the early days of the NBA blogosphere, even though many of those blogs have established new opportunities for talented people. Even though we’re seeing an established media tone on aggregated blog networks, large-scale content farms, and the ‘bro it down and break it down’ voice that is widely used on television, I’ll always remember that it came from the formative, now-extinct NBA blogosphere. But I guess none of that really matters to the casual fan, anyway.</p></blockquote>

<p>Carles is right; ultimately most of us don’t care. In fact, as fan we’ve come to expect our sports fed to us with a certain superficiality.</p>

<p>There’s a reason for this: In most cases, though, fan journalism articulates truths and feelings that traditional media  — in its obsession with adhering to professional standards of journalism — used to ignore.</p>

<p>But at the center, and most fundamental, is a gradual shift in editorial authority, from traditional news outlets to athletes themselves.</p>

<p>In athletes, we are discovering an entirely new sphere of information we’ve have never fully had insight to: the inner thoughts of the most elite athletes in all of humanity.</p>

<p> This is something historic, I think. In the history of sports, we tend to view athletes as non-people, or martyrs. See: Greek heroes in the Colosseum. More recently, David Foster Wallace stated that athletes catalyze the awareness of having a body. In this view of sports, it isn’t about athletes at all: it’s about us  and our obsession with playing out narratives.</p>

<p> &lt;!&mdash; (Long footnote: let’s differentiate this from two concurrent trends:</p>

<p>Let’s also differentiate this from the shift in editorial authority away from all news outlets: yes, this is happening but its generally a case of economics — the business model not working. Nobody contests the value of journalism to uncover and explain important issues. In contrast, sports journalism is currently a booming industry, yet its legitimacy is crumbling underneath its feet. Why?)</p>

<p>(footnote: this article focuses on the NBA, because its happening first in the NBA. Chris Kluwe writes some of the most cerebral articles in all of sports, and Curt Schilling had a controversial blog back in the day)</p>

<p>It started with Charles Barkley (footnote here: Barkley really was one of the few unique people who could have started this; see the Olympics Documentary, where an NBA player said that Barkley truly doesn’t give a fuck; Simmons says he was one of the few genuinely funny athletes), but it really was the Convergence of a lot of things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Information Age, Twitter</li>
</ol>


<p>we don’t know how to process the deluge of information</p>

<ol>
<li><p>High school basketball leagues</p></li>
<li><p>Fans becoming more sophisticated — metrics, despising Rick Reilly, Skip Bayless, Stephen A Smith</p></li>
<li><p>The legitimacy and supremacy of street culture in sports</p></li>
</ol>


<p>starting with Iverson</p>

<p>sports persists with this faux professionalism</p>

<p>now, ebonics and black language are accepted in conversation like not previously</p>

<p>fuck this [sic]</p>

<p>End with Lebron tweet vs. quote: very, very different, but both pablam.</p>

<p>“When art critics get together they talk about Form and Structure and Meaning. When artists get together they talk about where you can buy cheap turpentine.” — Picasso</p>

<p>Picasso once said, “when art critics get together, they talk about things like Form and Structure. When artists meet, they ask where to get cheap turpentine.” Again, this is an awkward transitory phase, and I look forward to the first iconic moment (NBA player podcast? talk show?) , and when it happens, I can’t wait to become a fan of that thing we’ll still call Sports.
