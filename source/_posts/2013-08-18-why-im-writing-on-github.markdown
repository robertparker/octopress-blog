_"It's immensely important that great poems be written, but it makes not a jot of difference who writes them."_  - Ezra Pound

Writers and coders strike me as similar. They learn and understand the backbone of language, they play with it, and they ultimately create and destroy on top of it. It comes as no surprise that some great Coders are also great writers ([here's.](http://chadfowler.com/) [some.](https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts) [examples](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/)).

But then, why aren't more writers on GitHub?

I don't mean tech bloggers. I mean the journalist who has dozens of back-and-forths with her editor. I mean the MFA who has re-written the same sentence twenty times. I mean the teenager who is writing the next Great American Novel. You know, Writers. 

I don't know. I'm not a Writer and I'm not a Coder, but I write and I code. And GitHub seems immensely practical for both.

## Why It Works For Me
#### versioning
In college, my personal record for multiple versions of a manuscript was 22. Impressive, but there are solutions now. Google Docs and Dropbox have been revelations in solving the challenges of editing a document across different machines. Bloggging platforms also allow you to access and edit a post anywhere in the cloud.

Git surpasses both those services. Enter `git commit -m 'my message'` and `git diff version1..version2 my_file`. Diffs allows me to see the text differences between any two of my versions, and commits allow me to comment on the specific save. Now I know exactly what changed every time I hit `Ctrl+S`.

<!-- #### forking
Let's say I wanted to rewrite this article to submit to an online magazine. In that case, `git clone my_article` lets me rewrite in an entirely different style, while I can use `git branch new_revision` to begin a new train of thought I can merge into my final draft later.

#### the blank paper
Blogging platforms (Blogger, Tumblr, Medium) have been the only medium for self-publication on the Internet for writers. And two significant ways they inherit the same poor psychology as paper publication: 

each one present you with a static and blank sheet of paper, or the last version you wrote. 

#### the static opinion
I once saw Junot Diaz speak at the National Book Festival. I head just finished reading _The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao_ and thought it was the a near perfect book. It surprised me to hear that he wished it had steeped in his brain for longer, and then he consider a lot of the parts to be messed up.

## Why It Doesn't
#### writing doesn't scale

#### the language of Git is not intuitive for software development, not manuscript writing

## The Economics of Version Control
The Nobel-winning economist Douglass North once wrote that the establishment of property rights has been the cornerstone of innovation in our society: people keep creating when they know they can reap benefits -- called "rents" -- from their work. 

North (and much of economics) assume "rents" to be money. In today's open source world, they're mistaken: the better part of the Internet has built by volunteers, whose only reward is either respect within the online community or
