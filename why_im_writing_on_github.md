# Why I'm Writing on GitHub

_"It's immensely important that great poems be written, but it makes not a jot of difference who writes them."_  -- Ezra Pound

Writers and coders strike me as similar. They learn and understand the backbone of language, they play with it, and they ultimately create and destroy on top of it. It comes as no surprise that some great programmers are also great writers ([here's.](http://chadfowler.com/) [some.](https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts) [examples.](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/)).

But then, why aren't more writers on GitHub?

I don't mean tech bloggers. I mean the journalist who has dozens of back-and-forth revisions with her editor. I mean the MFA who has re-written the same sentence twenty times. I mean the teenager who dropped out of high school to write the next Great American Novel. You know, Writers. 

I don't know. I'm not a Writer and I'm not a Coder, but I write and I code. And GitHub seems immensely practical for both.

## Why It Works For Me
#### versioning
In college, my personal record for multiple versions of a manuscript was 22. Impressive, but there are solutions now. Google Docs and Dropbox have been revelations in solving the challenges of editing a document across different devices. Bloggging platforms also allow you to access and edit a post anywhere in the cloud.

Git surpasses both those services. Enter `git commit -m 'my message'` and `git diff version1..version2 my_file`. Git diff allows me to see the text differences between any two of my versions, and commits allow me to comment on the specific save. 

But in both cases, these inherit the same poor psychology as paper publication.

#### the blank paper
Blogging platforms (Blogger, Tumblr, Medium) have been the only medium for self-publication on the Internet for writers. And two significant ways they inherit the same poor psychology as paper publication: 

each one present you with a static and blank sheet of paper, or the last version you wrote. 

#### the static opinion
I once saw Junot Diaz speak at the National Book Festival. I head just finished reading _The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao_ and thought it was the a near perfect book. It surprised me to hear that he wished it had steeped in his brain for longer, and then he consider a lot of the parts to be messed up.
