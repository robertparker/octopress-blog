# Why I'm Writing on GitHub

_"It's immensely important that great poems be written, but it makes not a jot of difference who writes them."_  -- Ezra Pound

Writers and coders strike me as similar. They learn and understand the backbone of language, they play with it, and they ultimately create and destroy on top of it.

It surprised me to hear that he wished it had steeped in his brain for longer, and then he consider a lot of the parts to be messed up.
