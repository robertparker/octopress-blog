# Why I'm Writing on GitHub

_"It's immensely important that great poems be written, but it makes not a jot of difference who writes them."_  -- Ezra Pound

Writers and coders strike me as similar. They learn and understand the backbone of language, they play with it, and they ultimately create and destroy on top of it. It comes as no surprise that some great programmers are also great writers ([example one.](http://chadfowler.com/)|[example two.](https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts)).

But then, why don't more writers code?

I don't know. I'm not a Writer and I'm not a Coder, but I write and I code. And GitHub seems immensely practical for both.

## Why It Works For Me
#### versioning
There is a clear advantage in not having to manage multiple versions of a single manuscript (my personal record was 22 in college).  But the solutions are out there. Google Docs and Dropbox have been revelations in solving the challenges of editing a document across different devices. Bloggging platforms also allow you to access and edit a post anywhere in the cloud.

But in both cases, these inherit the same poor psychology as paper publication.

#### the blank paper
Blogging platforms (Blogger, Tumblr, Medium) have been the only medium for self-publication on the Internet for writers. And two significant ways they inherit the same poor psychology as paper publication: 

each one present you with a static and blank sheet of paper, or the last version you wrote. 

#### the static opinion
I once saw Junot Diaz speak at the National Book Festival. I head just finished reading _The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao_ and thought it was the a near perfect book. It surprised me to hear that he wished it had steeped in his brain for longer, and then he consider a lot of the parts to be messed up.
